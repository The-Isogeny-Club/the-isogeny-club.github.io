<p>Recent work of Castryck, Houben, Merz, Mula, Buuren, and Vercauteren (2023) introduced a class of pairings on oriented supersingular elliptic curves that yield polynomial-time attacks on certain instances of the vectorization problem. In this talk, I'll discuss recent work by myself and Katherine Stange that extends the scope of these attacks. The key ingredient is the introduction of a new class of pairings which are sesquilinear with respect to the module structure of an elliptic curve with CM by a given imaginary quadratic order. Time permitting, I'll also discuss how we used these sesquilinear pairings to extend recent work of De Feo, Fouotsa, and Panny by providing new reductions between certain modular isogeny problems.</p>
