<p>SQIsign is the first isogeny scheme considered for practical use that requires computations in a quaternion algebra. These computations operate on secret data, and thus they must be protected against side-channel attacks. However, relatively little research on secure implementations of SQIsign has been reported in the literature, possibly due to the many variants and the high complexity of the scheme.</p>
<p>Lattice reduction is a key component of the signing procedure of all SQIsign variants, and it is the most performance-critical basic algorithm on the quaternion side of the scheme. Given that lattice reduction has been used previously in cryptanalysis, but not in constructive cryptography, no known lattice reduction algorithm is resistant against timing side-channels.</p>
<p>This talk presents a new, constant-time lattice reduction algorithm, developed in collaboration with Ottó Hanyecz, Alexander Karenin, Elena Kirshanova and Péter Kutas. We first explore the use of lattice reduction in SQIsign. Then, we analyze different existing lattice reduction algorithms, and present our constant-time version, which is based on the BKZ-2 algorithm. Finally, we explain some implementation choices and discuss the performance using two sets of parameters: one for provable guarantees on its output, and one for speed with a reasonable success rate.</p>
