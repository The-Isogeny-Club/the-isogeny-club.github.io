<p>In this talk we are going to present a family of group actions by generalized class groups of imaginary quadratic orders on oriented supersingular elliptic curves, together with appropriate level structure. This generalises recent observations by Galbraith, Perrin and Voloch for the ray class group, and it provides a framework to reinterpret other known examples, like SCALLOP. This is based on work with S. Arpin, W. Castryick, J. Eriksen and F. Vercauteren.</p>
