<p>Supersingular isogeny graphs possess many properties that make it an interesting
    object to study mathematically as well as attempt to apply for cryptographic purposes.
    In this talk, Bruno will present one of these properties and showcase how it can be applied
    to construct a commitment scheme. This commitment scheme has strong security properties
    and doesnâ€™t require random oracles.</p>
