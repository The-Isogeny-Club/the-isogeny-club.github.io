<p> The general supersingular isogeny problem is the foundational hardness assumption
    underpinning
    isogeny-based cryptography. Its conjectured classical and quantum hardness has cemented
    isogenies
    as a promising tool for building post-quantum secure protocols. </p>

<p>In this talk, we will look at the general isogeny problem in low dimensions. More
    specifically,
    we consider the hardness of finding an isogeny between two given supersingular elliptic
    curves
    or two superspecial abelian surfaces defined over ùîΩ<sub>p<sup>2</sup></sub>. Viewing these
    as path finding problems
    in a related isogeny graph, we introduce a general framework for solving these problems and
    present
    the state-of-the-art attacks against them. We will also discuss a strategy for improving
    their concrete
    complexity, based on joint work with Craig Costello, Sam Frengley and Jia Shi.</p>
