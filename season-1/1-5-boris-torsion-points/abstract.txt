<p> The first isogeny-based key exchange is the CRS (Couveignes - Rostovtsev - Stolbunov)
    scheme, which uses
    ordinary isogenies. The CRS scheme is relatively slow and is subject to a sub-exponential
    quantum attack.
    This motivated Jao and De Feo to suggest SIDH, which uses supersingular isogenies that, as
    opposed to ordinary
    isogenies, do not commute. To solve this commutativity issue, Jao and De Feo publish images
    of torsion points
    through the secret isogeny. SIDH was then faster and was not vulnerable to sub-exponential
    quantum attacks.</p>

<p>Today, the picture has changed considerably. The torsion point images have been used to
    design both
    adaptive and passive attacks on SIDH. Recently, we reached the "point de non retour":
    they were used to design a polynomial classical attack on SIDH. </p>

<p>In this talk, we will tell the story of the torsion point images in SIDH. We will go through
    their role
    in the design of SIDH, and in the design of both adaptive and passive attacks on SIDH.</p>
