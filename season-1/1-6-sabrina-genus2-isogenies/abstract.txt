<p>Elliptic curves are abelian varieties of dimension one. It is only natural to consider
    generalizations of isogeny-based
    cryptographic protocols to higher dimensions. Apart from mathematical curiosity, the recent
    attacks on SIDH have shown
    that it is essential to study such generalizations in order to understand the security of
    elliptic curve based protocols.</p>

<p>This talk gives an introduction to Jacobians of genus-2 curves (abelian varieties of
    dimension 2) and isogenies in this setting.
    The focus lies on the computation of Richelot isogenies.</p>
