<p> The quantum computer is a threat to cryptography as it can solve the problems upon which
    relies the security of a lot of protocols.
    Isogeny-based cryptography is a family of protocols relying on the hardness of finding an
    isogeny between two supersingular elliptic curves,
    a problem assumed hard even for a quantum computer. In this talk, we focus on the connection
    between isogeny-based cryptography
    and quaternion algebras called the Deuring correspondence. </p>

<p>We will start with a generic overview of the applications of the Deuring correspondence to
    isogeny-based cryptography,
    before presenting a new algorithm to compute and realize the Deuring correspondence.
    In particular, this can be applied to speed-up the SQISign signature scheme.</p>
