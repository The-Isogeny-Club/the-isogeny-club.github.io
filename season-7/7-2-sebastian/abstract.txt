<p>In this talk we will discuss how different modular polynomials can be used to count l-isogenies. After a brief introduction to modular curves, we will first recap the construction of the classical modular polynomial and its relation to l-isogenies. With this understanding as a base point, we then introduce resultants as a general tool to relate other modular polynomials back to the classical one.</p>
<p>To illustrate our resultant approach, we consider the canonical, Atkin, and Weber modular polynomials: For each of these polynomials we first discuss their definition using the modular picture and indicate how this theory gives a relation to l-isogenies over the complex numbers. Then we convert this understanding into a resultant equation, which allows us to derive an exact classification of how to count the l-isogenies between two j-invariants over any field whose characteristic is not equal to l.</p>
<p>Finally, we briefly discuss how this understanding of modular polynomials can be applied to obtain more efficient isogeny proofs of knowledge with generic proof techniques.</p>
