<p>The Ihara zeta function of a graph is a counting functions for the number of cycles of different lengths in the graph. It captures many interesting properties of the graph, including spectral properties of interest to isogenists. For example, the Ihara zeta function of a regular graph G satisfies a version of the Riemann Hypothesis if and only if G is a Ramanujan graph. Unfortunately, the classical theory of Ihara zeta functions doesn't quite capture the bizarre behavior that can occur when studying non-backtracking walks in isogeny graphs, particularly when the graphs have level structure. In this talk, we introduce a combinatorial framework that captures non-backtracking walks in isogeny graphs with level structure, then use this to study the Ihara zeta functions of these graphs. In the end, we give applications to cycle counting and point-counting on modular curves.</p>
