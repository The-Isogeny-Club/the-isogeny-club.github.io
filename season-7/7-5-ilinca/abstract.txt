<p>In this talk, using the language of categories, I introduce a novel framework abstracting the key features of the isogeny-based post-quantum signature scheme SQIsign. I then show how to construct a digital signature within this framework that, once instantiated with isogenies, recovers (classical) SQIsign. I also illustrate how the framework leads to more advanced primitives, such as a chameleon hash function. I present an instantiation of the framework based on isogenies of supersingular elliptic curves.</p>
