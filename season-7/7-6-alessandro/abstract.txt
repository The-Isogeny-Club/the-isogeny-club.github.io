<p>In this talk, we present an efficient recipe to lift an isogeny defined over a finite field of characteristic p
to an isogeny over a p-adic field, with arbitrarily high precision.
This recipe is general and applies to all isogeny representations used in isogeny-based cryptography
(e.g. Vélu chains, HD representations).</p>

<p>As an application, we adapt the approach of Satoh's point counting algorithm
to the problem of computing traces of separable endomorphisms of elliptic curves over finite fields
by p-adically lifting these endomorphisms.
The resulting trace computation algorithm is faster than the Schoof-style state-of-the-art.</p>

<p>Based on joint work with Lorenz Panny and Damien Robert.</p>
