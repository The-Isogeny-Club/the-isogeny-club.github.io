<p>SQIsign is the leading digital signature from isogenies.
While there have been many improvements to the scheme in the last
couple of years, until recently no variant of SQIsign had a complete
proof of security. This talk is all about proving the security of SQIsign.
Throughout, we will focus on the variant of SQIsign submitted to the
round 2 of the NIST competition. However, the hope is that the techniques discussed can be used to
analyze future variants as well.</p>
<p>For the first half of the talk, we focus on classical security.
We will discuss a new framework, called "Fiat--Shamir with hints",
that captures SQIsign and related protocols.
Using this framework, we analyze the EUF-CMA security of SQIsign in ROM.</p>
<p> In the second half of the talk, we turn to quantum security.
Currently, we do not know how to prove that SQIsign is QROM secure,
due to issues with quantum rewinding.
To give evidence for the quantum security of SQIsign, we introduce a
new idealized model called the Algebraic Isogeny Model (AIM).
It is the analogue of the Algebraic Group Model for general isogeny protocols.
In the AIM, the QROM security of SQIsign can be proved easily, without
the need for any quantum rewinding techniques.
We view this as a motivating example of how the AIM could become a
powerful tool for the isogeny community.</p>
