<p>In Season 2 Episode 4 of the Isogeny Club, we got introduced to the problem of finding smooth twins/twin smooth integers and saw their relevance to isogeny-based cryptography. The methods presented in that episode either found medium-sized smooth twins with a very small smoothness bound or large smooth twins with a not-so-small smoothness bound. One would ideally like to find large smooth twins with a very small smoothness bound but there is a computational obstruction to this task with the current methods. In this episode, we bridge this gap and present an algorithm to find such large smooth twins. To achieve this, we repurpose an old idea from Schnorr that factored integers and computed discrete logarithms using a "prime number lattice". With this we are able to find a 213-bit smooth twin with a significantly smaller smoothness bound compared to those found in prior work. In addition, we put our algorithm in practice to find new SQIsign1D primes and diversify the collection of such primes. This work was done in collaboration with Erik Mulder and Wessel van Woerden.</p>
