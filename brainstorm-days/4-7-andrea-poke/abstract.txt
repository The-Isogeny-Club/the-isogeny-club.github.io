<p>In this talk, we describe a new framework, POKE, to build cryptographic protocols from irrational isogenies using higher-dimensional representations.</p>

<p>We first discuss how higher-dimensional representations of non-smooth isogenies work, and then we introduce algorithmic building blocks to manipulate them. In particular, we obtain an efficient way to compute the pushforward of non-smooth isogenies under secret isogenies, and we rely on this to obtain a protocol that lets two parties obtain a shared secret.</p>

<p>By using these building blocks, we propose three constructions: the first is a PKE protocol, which is one of the most compact post-quantum PKEs and possibly the most efficient isogeny-based PKE to date. We then extend the PKE construction to a split KEM (a PKE variant where both parties hold long term secrets) by relying on a novel validation technique that ensures the correctness of uni/bin/ter-SIDH public keys. The third construction builds upon the split KEM and its validation method to obtain a round-optimal verifiable OPRF. It is the first such construction that does not require more than ùúÜ isogeny computations, and it is significantly more compact and more efficient than all other isogeny-based OPRFs.</p>
