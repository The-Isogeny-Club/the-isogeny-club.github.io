In this talk, Tomoki proposes a novel computational problem
named the Long Isogeny with Torsion (LIT) problem, which is the problem
of computing a hidden isogeny from two given supersingular elliptic curves
and information on torsion points of relatively small order. By considering
this problem, we can construct a secure SIDH diagram in which all isogenies
are of degree linearly related to the security parameter λ. Based on the
hardness of the LIT problem, Tomoki proposes a new isogeny-based key
encapsulation mechanism named IS-CUBE, which uses about an 8λ-bit prime
and a random starting curve.
