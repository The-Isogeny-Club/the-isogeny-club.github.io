Let E be a supersingular elliptic curve with known endomorphism and let Ï† be an isogeny 
whose domain is E. When the isogeny has a smooth degree, then one can easily compute the endomorphism
ring of the codomain. How about when the isogeny degree is not smooth? In this case we cannot write down our 
isogeny efficiently, but we have a representation of the isogeny which allows us to evaluate the isogeny efficiently 
at any point. The SIDH attacks do not seem to help here as the isogeny degree is not smooth and its kernel is defined
over a very large extension.</p>

<p>The key idea to tackle this problem is to consider a non-abelian group action on the set
of fixed degree isogenies. In this talk, we describe this method in detail and convince cryptographers that non-abelian 
hidden subgroup problems can be very useful in cryptography.</p>
