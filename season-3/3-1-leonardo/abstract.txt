<p>With David Kohel, we defined an OSIDH protocol for oriented supersingular
isogeny Diffie-Hellman, by imposing the data of an orientation by an
imaginary quadratic ring on the category of supersingular elliptic curves.
One of the advantages of working in this general framework is that the group
action by the class group can be carried out effectively solely on the sequence
of moduli points on a modular curve, thereby avoiding expensive generic isogeny
computations or the requirement of rational torsion points.</p>

<p>The proposed attacks of Onuki and Dartois-De Feo and their analyses motivate
the idea of enlarging the class group without touching the key space using clouds.
In this talk, we propose two approaches to augment the OSIDH protocol in a way
that no effective data is transmitted for a third party to compute cycle relations.
In both cases, it comes down to an extension of the initial chain by the two
parties seperately.</p>

<p>We also consider the role of a formal orientation, equipping the formal group
of each curve with compatible (formal) endomorphism rings. It is well-known
that the endomorphism ring is the p-adic completion of the endomorphism ring
and every such formal group is isomorphic. We will review some arithmetic on
formal groups of elliptic curves and construct formal orientations, with a view
to create formal orientations of supersingular isogeny graphs and explore the
implications for effective computation and navigation.</p>
