<p>In this talk, we motivate and present an effective group action based on isogenies of supersingular
curves, called SCALLOP. Similar to CSIDH and OSIDH, an imaginary orderâ€™s class group acts on a set
of oriented supersingular elliptic curves. Its main benefit compared to CSIDH is that the structure
of the acting class group can be easily computed - it can even be partially controlled when choosing
parameters. This data is required to uniquely represent and efficiently act by arbitrary group
elements which is useful for example when constructing efficient signatures.</p>

<p>The class group structure for the smallest parameter set of CSIDH could be computed with a world
record class group computation - leading to CSI-FiSh. However, for larger security levels computing
the structure in CSIDH remains elusive with currently known methods. On the other hand, SCALLOP can
be instantiated for security levels comparable to CSIDH-512 and CSIDH-1024 using only modest
computational resources. We discuss several of our design choices with respect to security and
computational efficiency. Asymptotically, some scaling issues remain and while evaluating the SCALLOP
group action is feasible, its performance requires further improvement before it can be used for
practical applications.</p>
