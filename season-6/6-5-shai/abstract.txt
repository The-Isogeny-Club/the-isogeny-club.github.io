<p>Verifiable pseudorandom functions (VRFs) are keyed functions whose output is indistinguishable from random values in the image set, along with an associated proof of honest evaluation. VRFs are used in blockchain consensus, DNSSec, and multiparty protocols requiring verifiable randomness. Constructing efficient post-quantum VRFs has been an open problem until recent years, with candidate protocols requiring novel assumptions to achieve efficiency.</p>

<p>In this talk, consisting of two parts, we will first introduce and motivate a novel computational assumption based on a suitable instantiation of the CGL hash function: loosely, given fixed length messages m and uniform key k, the output of CGL(m||k) is "unpredictable". This, together with a suitable proof of valid evaluation, allows us to construct a VRF in the random oracle model. In the second part, we will discuss why isogenies are a good fit for generic proof systems (zk-SNARKs), possible applications, and how to construct Rank 1 Constraint System (R1CS) instances which encode knowledge of a cyclic isogeny and knowledge of a CGL preimage.</p>
