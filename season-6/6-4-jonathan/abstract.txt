<p>Supersingular isogeny graphs are known for being easy to get lost in: they are Ramanujan graphs (random walks converge very rapidly to the uniform distribution) and there is no known efficient algorithm for finding a path from one general vertex to another. But there are also many internal structures and special subsets with distinct behaviors. Features such as cycle length statistics, curves defined over F_p, and curves that have a non-integer endomorphism of small degree could each potentially be used as landmarks, helping someone lost in an isogeny graph to figure out where they are and how to get to their desired destination. This talk will discuss several results about these internal structures, as well as the corresponding facts about quaternion orders that are used to prove them. The talk includes joint work with Dan Boneh and with Eyal Goren.
