<p> An isogeny can be defined over a given field even when its kernel generators, 
    which we need for efficient VÃ©lu formulae, are only defined over some extension.
    How can we efficiently evaluate these isogenies?</p>
    
<p>In this talk, we will present some new algorithms for this and related problems.</p>
