<p>In Season one, talk four of the Isogeny Club, we saw a presentation on 
    computing the Deuring correspondence. The efficiency of this computation 
    depends a lot on the characteristic one is working over, and applications 
    such as SQIsign, require primes p of a special form to do this computation.</p>

<p>In this presentation, we look at computing the Deuring correspondence in 
    general characteristic, i.e. without assuming any special form of the prime
    p being used. We start by recalling a "standard" algorithm for computing 
    the Deuring correspondence, before discussing specific optimisations for 
    the case of general characteristic.</p>
