<p>The SQISign isogeny-based post-quantum digital signature scheme introduced by
    De Feo, Kohel, Leroux, Petit and Wesolowski outputs very compact signatures
    at the expense of a high signature time.</p>
    
<p>In this talk, we introduce a new scheme
    based on SQISign and the polynomial time torsion point attacks against SIDH due to
    Castryck, Decru, Maino, Martindale and Robert to sign with higher dimensional isogenies.
    This scheme remains to be implemented but we expect a significant signature time
    improvement, better security properties and signatures even more compact than in
    the original SQISign scheme.</p>
