<p>An oblivious pseudorandom function, or OPRF, is an important primitive that is 
    used to build many advanced cryptographic protocols. 
    Despite its relevance, very few post-quantum solutions exist.</p>

<p>In this talk, we present a novel OPRF protocol that is post-quantum, verifiable,
    round-optimal, and moderately compact. The protocol is based on a previous SIDH-based
    construction by Boneh et al., which was later shown to be insecure due to an attack on
    its one-more unpredictability. We propose an efficient countermeasure against this attack,
    and we demonstrate how to adapt the protocol to work with the countermeasures against
    the SIDH attacks. To achieve this, we also propose the first proof of isogeny knowledge
    that is compatible with masked torsion points, which may be of independent interest.
    We also design a novel non-interactive proof of knowledge of parallel isogenies,
    which reduces the number of communication rounds of the OPRF to the theoretically-optimal two.
    Putting everything together, we obtain the most compact post-quantum verifiable OPRF protocol.
