To study supersingular isogeny graphs, one may add to the elliptic curves the information of
an orientation,
or a particular embedding of an imaginary quadratic field into the endomorphism ring of the
curve.
Recent cryptographic protocols (Séta, OSIDH) have made use of orientations to define new
hard problems on
supersingular isogeny graphs. The mathematics of orientations have been studied for a long
time, but the
algorithmic implications are just now being understood.</p>

<p>As part of a recent Women in Numbers 5 (WIN5) collaboration, my collaborators and I use
orientations towards
two different goals: 1. path-finding algorithms in the supersingular ℓ-isogeny graph and 2.
understanding
and counting cycles in the supersingular ℓ-isogeny graph.
In this talk, we will first introduce the theory of orientations and discuss the relevant
hard problems.
We will go on to describe the path-finding algorithms and the theory behind cycle-counting
which stem from adding
orientations to supersingular elliptic curves.
